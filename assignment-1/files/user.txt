# This file works as follows:
# key,value
# this is the same as {'key': 'value'}
#
# If you want a list, its:
# key,"value, value, value"
# this is the equivalent of {'list_name': [value, value, value]}
#
# A nested dict works as follows
# name,
# key,value
#
# 
# This structure must end on a blank line to define end of nesting
# The example above is the equivalent to:
# {'name': {'key': 'value'}}
