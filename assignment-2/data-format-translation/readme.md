# Data format translation servers - Part I

## Assignment

Create at least two servers in two different programming languages with REST
APIs. 

Create endpoints that:
* read the files that you created last week
* parse the files
* send them as response

You must figure out what data format to send as response.

You are allowed to split the responsibility between the servers if you are 
pressed for time. I.e. ServerA reads XML, CSV. ServerB reads YAML, TXT, JSON.
